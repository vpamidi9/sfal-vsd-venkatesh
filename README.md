<summary>Day 1 - Introudction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis </summary>


## Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

## Introduction to iVerilog OpenSource Simulator


**iverilog** : Icarus Verilog, commonly known as Iverilog, is an open-source tool used for the simulation and synthesis of digital circuits described in Verilog hardware description language (HDL).

Primarily, Iverilog is used to simulate Verilog designs, allowing designers to verify the functionality of their digital circuits before physical implementation.

Let's take good_mux.v design as an example

```
module good_mux (input i0 , input i1 , input sel , output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
	if(sel)
		y <= i1;
	else 
		y <= i0;
end
endmodule
```

Let's see it's Testbench tb_good_mux.v

```
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module tb_good_mux;
	// Inputs
	reg i0,i1,sel;
	// Outputs
	wire y;

        // Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
	good_mux uut (
		.sel(sel),
		.i0(i0),
		.i1(i1),
		.y(y)
	);

	initial begin
	$dumpfile("tb_good_mux.vcd");
	$dumpvars(0,tb_good_mux);
	// Initialize Inputs
	sel = 0;
	i0 = 0;
	i1 = 0;
	#300 $finish;
	end

always #75 sel = ~sel;
always #10 i0 = ~i0;
always #55 i1 = ~i1;
endmodule
```
**Simulation of good_mux**
```
$ iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```
The output will be **a.out** which specifies the output file for the compiled simulation.
```
$ ./a.out
```
This command runs the simulation and generates a waveform dump file (in this case, tb_good_mux.vcd) as specified in the testbench.

To view the simulation results, use a waveform viewer like GTKWave. Open GTKWave and load the generated VCD file:
```
$ gtkwave example_tb.vcd
```
GTKWave will open, allowing you to inspect the signals and verify the behavior of your design

## Introduction to Yosys

Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It is used primarily for converting high-level Verilog descriptions of digital circuits into gate-level netlists that can be implemented on FPGAs or used for ASIC design. Yosys is highly versatile and supports various front-end and back-end tools, making it a valuable tool for digital design and synthesis.

Inputs for Yosys tool: Design(.v), liberty(.lib)
Output: Netlist file (.net.v)

	<summary>Day 2 - Timing libs, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis and Efficient Flop Coding Styles </summary>

## Day 2:Timing libs, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis and Efficient Flop Coding Styles

## Introduction to timing.lib

A .lib file, also known as a Liberty file, is a standard format used in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry to describe the timing, power, and area characteristics of the standard cells in a digital library.

**Key Contents of a .lib File:** Timing information, Power information, Area information, Opearating conditions, Pin descritions.

In this lab, we use **sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib**. Here's a breakdown of the filename and what each part signifies:

	sky130: Refers to the 130nm technology node provided by SkyWater Technology Foundry.

	fd: Stands for fully-depleted, indicating the type of process technology.

	sc: Stands for standard cell.

	hd: Stands for high-density standard cell library.

	tt: Typical process corner (typical-typical).

	025C: The temperature condition at which the library data is characterized (25Â°C).

	1v80: The operating voltage condition (1.8V).

## Different Methods for Flip-Flop Coding and Performance Enhancement

**Why are flops necessary, and how do they mitigate glitches in the circuit?**

Glitches can manifest in digital circuits due to factors like signal propagation delays, noise interference, or timing discrepancies. Flops play a crucial role in preventing glitches during circuit operation through the following mechanisms:

**Synchronization:** Flops operate as edge-triggered components, responding exclusively to transitions in the input signal, such as rising or falling edges. This synchronization mechanism ensures that the output changes occur only at specific moments, minimizing the potential for glitches induced by transient signal fluctuations.

**Timing Control:** Flops are typically governed by a clock signal, ensuring that all circuit activities unfold synchronously. This synchronized operation eliminates timing discrepancies that could otherwise lead to glitches stemming from data arriving at disparate time
