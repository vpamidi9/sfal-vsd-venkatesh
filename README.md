## Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

### Introduction to iVerilog OpenSource Simulator

**iverilog**: Icarus Verilog, commonly known as Iverilog, is an open-source tool used for the simulation and synthesis of digital circuits described in Verilog hardware description language (HDL).

Primarily, Iverilog is used to simulate Verilog designs, allowing designers to verify the functionality of their digital circuits before physical implementation.

Let's take `good_mux.v` design as an example:

```verilog
module good_mux (input i0 , input i1 , input sel , output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
    if(sel)
        y <= i1;
    else 
        y <= i0;
end
endmodule
```

Let's see its Testbench `tb_good_mux.v`:

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module tb_good_mux;
// Inputs
reg i0,i1,sel;
// Outputs
wire y;

// Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
good_mux uut (
    .sel(sel),
    .i0(i0),
    .i1(i1),
    .y(y)
);

initial begin
    $dumpfile("tb_good_mux.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0,tb_good_mux);
    // Initialize Inputs
    sel = 0;
    i0 = 0;
    i1 = 0;
    #300 $finish;
end

always #75 sel = ~sel;
always #10 i0 = ~i0;
always #55 i1 = ~i1;
endmodule
```

**Simulation of good_mux:**

```sh
$ iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

The output will be **a.out** which specifies the output file for the compiled simulation.

```sh
$ ./a.out
```

This command runs the simulation and generates a waveform dump file (in this case, `tb_good_mux.vcd`) as specified in the testbench.

To view the simulation results, use a waveform viewer like GTKWave. Open GTKWave and load the generated VCD file:

```sh
$ gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

GTKWave will open, allowing you to inspect the signals and verify the behavior of your design.

## Timing libs, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis and Efficient Flop Coding Styles

## Introduction to timing.lib

A .lib file, also known as a Liberty file, is a standard format used in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry to describe the timing, power, and area characteristics of the standard cells in a digital library.

**Key Contents of a .lib File:** Timing information, Power information, Area information, Operating conditions, Pin descriptions.

In this lab, we use **sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib**. Here's a breakdown of the filename and what each part signifies:

- **sky130:** Refers to the 130nm technology node provided by SkyWater Technology Foundry.
- **fd:** Stands for fully-depleted, indicating the type of process technology.
- **sc:** Stands for standard cell.
- **hd:** Stands for high-density standard cell library.
- **tt:** Typical process corner (typical-typical).
- **025C:** The temperature condition at which the library data is characterized (25¬∞C).
- **1v80:** The operating voltage condition (1.8V).

## Different Methods for Flip-Flop Coding and Performance Enhancement

**Why are flops necessary, and how do they mitigate glitches in the circuit?**

Glitches can manifest in digital circuits due to factors like signal propagation delays, noise interference, or timing discrepancies. Flops play a crucial role in preventing glitches during circuit operation through the following mechanisms:

- **Synchronization:** Flops operate as edge-triggered components, responding exclusively to transitions in the input signal, such as rising or falling edges. This synchronization mechanism ensures that the output changes occur only at specific moments, minimizing the potential for glitches induced by transient signal fluctuations.
- **Timing Control:** Flops are typically governed by a clock signal, ensuring that all circuit activities unfold synchronously. This synchronized operation eliminates timing discrepancies that could otherwise lead to glitches stemming from data arriving at disparate times.

**Flop coding styles:**

- **Simulation of Asynchronous Reset D-Flip Flop using iverilog followed by GTKWave**

**Synthesis of Asynchronous Reset D-Flip Flop using yosys:**

  Here, we have to map the Flip-Flops to the *dfflib* which is present in *sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib*

  Here's the command for mapping the flipflops to the dfflib:

  ```sh
  yosys> dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib
  ```

# Introduction to Logic Synthesis

## Logic Synthesis

### What is Logic Synthesis?
- Converts RTL description of a circuit into a netlist of logic gates and their connections.
- **HDL Compiler**: Converts RTL to Generic Boolean (without timing info).
- **Design Compiler**: Converts Generic Boolean into Target Technology (with timing info).

### What is Design Compiler?
- **Design Compiler (DC)**: EDA tool by Synopsys for Synthesis.
- **Interfaces**: `dc_shell` (text), Design Vision (graphical).
- **File Formats**:
  - `.db`: Library files.
  - `.ddc`: Design information, used across various Synopsys tools.
  - **SDC**: Design constraints (power, timing, area), uses TCL script.

### Design Compiler Flow

1. Set & link .db
2. Read .v file
3. Read SDC
4. Integrate the Design
5. Synthesize
6. Report
7. Check Quality of Results (qor) files
8. Write Netlist

### Netlist & Libraries

- Design is written using standard cells (gates, mux, flops, etc.) in `.db`.
- **Target Library**: Database with standard cell information (area, pin names, timing).
- Multiple libraries can be appended using link library.

### Getting Started

- **Specify Libraries**: Target & link libraries.
- **File Formats**:
  - **GUI**: `design_vision`
  - **Non-GUI**: `dc_shell`
  - **Switching to GUI**: `gui_start/start_gui`
- `.synopsys_dc.setup`: Used for integrating libraries at startup.

### TCL Tips

- Track bracket types.
- Use `$` to refer a variable.
- No `$` needed when assigning a variable.
- `"*"`: Matches string of characters.

# VSDBabySoC

## Overview

VSDBabySoC is a compact and robust RISCV-based System on Chip. The primary goal of designing this small SoC is to integrate and test three open-source IP cores together for the first time and to calibrate its analog components. VSDBabySoC includes an RVMYTH microprocessor, an 8x Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for generating a stable clock, and a 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) for communication with other analog devices.

## BabySoC Components

### RVMYTH
- **RVMYTH**: The RVMYTH core is a simple RISC V-based CPU designed for educational purposes and small-scale applications. It provides a practical example of a RISC-V processor implementation.

### PLL
- **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)**: A phase-locked loop or PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. PLLs are widely used for synchronization purposes, including clock generation and distribution.

### DAC
- **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**: A DAC is a system that converts a digital signal into an analog signal. DACs are widely used in modern communication systems, enabling the generation of digitally-defined transmission signals.

## What is a PLL?

A phase-locked loop (also phase lock loop or PLL) is a system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to its input. The two signals will have the same frequency and either no phase difference or a constant phase difference between them.

A PLL typically consists of the following components:
- **Phase Detector**: Compares the reference signal with the oscillator frequency and outputs an error signal.
- **Loop Filter**: Usually a low-pass filter that generates an error voltage from the error signal.
- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)**: Adjusts the oscillator frequency to lock to the input frequency, producing an output frequency equal to the input frequency with a constant phase shift.

A PLL may also include a frequency divider in its feedback loop to create an output that is a multiple of the reference frequency instead of one that is exactly equal to it.

## Why Off-Chip Clocks Can't Be Used All the Time?

Using off-chip clocks for all on-chip operations in VLSI design is often impractical due to several key factors:

### Clock Distribution Delays
The clock signal needs to be distributed to a multitude of blocks on the chip. If a single off-chip clock source is used, the long wires required for distribution can introduce significant delays.

### Clock Jitter
Off-chip clocks are more susceptible to clock jitter, which can degrade the performance and reliability of the system.

### Different Frequency Requirements
Various blocks on the chip may require different clock frequencies. For example, one block might need 200 MHz while another needs 100 MHz. It is challenging to accommodate these varying frequency requirements with a single off-chip clock source.

### Clock Accuracy (ppm)
Quartz crystals used for clock generation have a specified accuracy in parts per million (ppm). A higher ppm error implies greater deviation from the desired frequency, impacting timing precision in electronic systems.

### Frequency Stability
Frequency stability denotes the maximum frequency variation over the operating temperature range. Crystals with higher ppm errors may exhibit significant frequency variations with temperature changes, affecting the reliability of timing references, especially in extreme temperature conditions.

### Total Frequency Error
The total frequency error of a crystal is the sum of errors from frequency tolerance, frequency stability, and aging. A higher ppm error in any of these components can lead to a larger total frequency error, affecting the crystal's overall accuracy in maintaining precise timing references.

## Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)

A Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) converts a digital input signal into an analog output signal. The digital signal is represented by a binary code, a combination of bits 0 and 1.

### Components of a DAC
- **Binary Inputs**: The number of binary inputs of a DAC is generally a power of two.
- **Analog Output**: A single output representing the analog signal.

### Types of DACs
- **Weighted Resistor DAC**: Uses resistors with weighted values to convert the binary input into an analog output.

- **R-2R Ladder DAC**: Utilizes a repetitive structure of resistors with values of R and 2R to achieve the conversion.

 # VSDBabySoC Modelling Overview

## What is Modelling?

Modelling and Simulation (M&S) involves the use of physical or logical representations of systems to generate data that informs decisions and predictions. This approach is particularly prevalent in the VLSI domain where it aids in design, analysis, verification, and validation of electronic systems.

## Purpose of Modelling

System models are crafted to:
- Support the analysis and specification of systems.
- Aid in system design and architectural planning.
- Facilitate system verification and validation.
- Enhance communication related to system details and functionality.

## Modelling the VSDBabySoC

### System Overview

The VSDBabySoC is modeled to integrate and simulate the interactions between various IP cores within a system on a chip (SoC), which includes:
- **Initial Inputs**: Entry signals fed into the VSDBabySoC module.
- **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)**: Responsible for generating the appropriate clock signals for the system operations.
- **RVMYTH Processor**: Utilizes the clock signals to execute instructions and generate values.
- **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**: Converts the digital signals produced by the RVMYTH into analog output signals.

### Components
1. **RVMYTH**: A digital processing unit modeled using Hardware Description Language (HDL).
2. **PLL**: An analog component that generates stable clock signals.
3. **DAC**: An analog component that converts digital signals into analog outputs.

### Challenges in Modelling Mixed Signal Blocks

While digital blocks like RVMYTH can be easily modeled and simulated using HDLs such as Verilog, analog components like DACs and PLLs present a unique challenge as Verilog cannot directly synthesize analog designs. To overcome this, we use `real` data-types in Verilog to simulate analog functionalities and verify their logical correctness.

## Understanding the Simulation Waveform

The simulation waveform provides insights into various signals within the VSDBabySoC module:

- **CLK**: The input clock signal to the RVMYTH core, generated by the PLL.
- **reset**: An input reset signal to the RVMYTH core, sourced externally.
- **OUT**: The output signal from the VSDBabySoC module, typically provided by the DAC. Due to simulation constraints, this appears as a digital signal but represents an analog value in a real application.
- **RV_TO_DAC[9:0]**: A 10-bit output from the RVMYTH core's register #17, representing data sent to the DAC.
- **OUT (Real Data Type)**: This represents an analog output signal from the DAC, simulated as a real data type in Verilog.

### Key Points

- **Signal Origin**: The CLK and reset signals are crucial for the operational timing and initialization of the RVMYTH core.
- **Output Analysis**: The OUT signal, as well as RV_TO_DAC, show how digital values are processed and converted into analog outputs within the system, reflecting the functionality of digital-to-analog conversion.
- **Real Data Type Usage**: This simulation uses Verilog's real data types to mimic the behavior of analog signals, providing a closer approximation to how the system would perform in a real-world scenario.

 # VSDBabySoC Simulation Guide

## Importance of Pre-Synthesis and Post-Synthesis Simulation

### Why Pre-Synthesis Simulation?

Pre-synthesis simulation, often referred to as RTL simulation, is crucial for verifying the functional correctness of a design before the synthesis process. This type of simulation:

- **Focuses on Functionality**: It checks the logic functionality according to the design and code written, without the influence of physical constraints and delays.
- **Verifies Design Intent**: Ensures that the written code behaves as expected in a zero-delay environment, where events typically occur precisely at the active clock edge.
- **Detects Logical Errors**: Helps identify issues in the design logic before moving on to the more complex stage of synthesis, making debugging simpler and less costly.

### Why Post-Synthesis Simulation?

Post-synthesis simulation, also known as gate-level simulation (GLS), is performed after the synthesis process and includes delays and physical characteristics:

- **Includes Gate Delays**: This simulation incorporates the actual delays of gates and interconnects modeled in the synthesized netlist, providing a more accurate depiction of circuit behavior under real conditions.
- **Verifies Timing and Functionality**: It helps to detect both functional and timing errors introduced during the synthesis process, such as setup and hold violations.
- **Confirms Implementation Fidelity**: Ensures that the synthesis process has faithfully translated the RTL design into a gate-level netlist without altering its intended functionality.
- **Checks for Mismatches**: Identifies mismatches that might occur due to incorrect operator usage or unintended latch inference, which are not apparent in RTL simulation.
- **Dynamic Behavior Verification**: Gate-level simulation is critical for verifying dynamic behaviors of the circuit, such as clock gating and power-on reset, which cannot be accurately checked using static timing analysis alone.

### GLS: A Brief Introduction

The term "gate level" refers to the netlist view of a circuit, typically produced after logic synthesis. This view includes:

- **Netlist**: A complete connection list consisting of gates and IP models that exhibit both functional and timing behavior.
- **Simulation Modes**: While GLS can be performed with zero delay, it is commonly executed in unit delay mode or full timing mode to reflect real operational conditions.
- **Enhanced Confidence**: Performing GLS boosts confidence in the physical implementation of a design, ensuring that it meets all specified operational and performance criteria.

By conducting both pre-synthesis and post-synthesis simulations, designers can ensure that the VSDBabySoC operates correctly from both a functional and a timing perspective, thus significantly reducing the risk of costly revisions and silicon respins.

# Synthesis Process for VSDBabySoC

To synthesize the VSDBabySoC design, we need to convert the standard cell libraries into a `.db` format that can be used by synthesis tools such as Synopsys Design Compiler. Here's how you can accomplish this using the Synopsys Library Compiler (lc_shell):

## Step-by-Step Guide to Convert Libraries to `.db` Format

### Setting Up Your Environment
Ensure you are in the correct directory where the libraries are stored:
```bash
cd /home/venkatesh/VSDBabySoC/src/lib
```

### Reading the Library
Load the library file into the Library Compiler:
```bash
read_lib avsddac.lib
```

### Writing to `.db` Format
Convert the library to `.db` format using the `write_lib` command:
```bash
write_lib -format db avsddac -output avsddac.db
```

This process will generate a `.db` file, which is a binary format that can be read by Synopsys tools for further synthesis and analysis steps. This file will be essential for the synthesis of the VSDBabySoC, as it contains all necessary information about the standard cells used in the design, including their timing, power, and area characteristics.
